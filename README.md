# CodeAlpha_Background-Generator
The Background Generator website is a simple tool that allows users to create custom background gradients using two colors. By selecting colors using color input elements and clicking the "Generate" button, the website generates a linear gradient background that smoothly transitions from the first selected color to the second selected color. The generated background is displayed in a designated area on the page, providing users with a visual representation of the gradient. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to use for anyone looking to create unique and visually appealing backgrounds for their web projects.
